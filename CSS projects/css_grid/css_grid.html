            When you think of testimonials, you’re probably picturing the traditional quote type of testimonial. 

These short stories are powerful, credible, and highly effective. Particularly when you add the customer’s name, company, and image. 
You’ll often find quote testimonial examples on a website’s homepage and in any of their marketing materials. Thanks to their compact size, it’s easy to include a quote testimonial almost anywhere in your content without making it too distracting or ‘in-your-face’.

            Social media is a great place to find quote testimonial examples, and you might even find customer images that you can repurpose in your own marketing.

        <p class="card_quote">
            Video testimonials have become one of the most persuasive marketing tools in recent years. Entertaining, visual, engaging, and hard to fake, videos can be a highly effective business tool.
